MPPartitionResyncTest:
    <<: *P2_STRESS_TAGS
    Testname: MPPartitionResyncTest
    Component: *MP
    Summary: "Partition MP nodes and create 100 logical switches and verify
              that the state is synced across MPs after their communication
              is restored."

CCPPartitionResyncTest:
    <<: *P2_STRESS_TAGS
    Testname: CCPPartitionResyncTest
    Component: *CCP
    Summary: "Partition CCP nodes and create 100 logical switches and verify
              that the sharding is done on the newly created entities when the
              communication between CCP nodes is restored."

ExploratoryCCPResourceStarvation:
    <<: *P2_STRESS_TAGS
    Testname: ExploratoryCCPResourceStarvation
    Component: *CCP
    Summary: "Check that CCP is able to realize new desired state on the host
              as expected by MP even when it is undergoing transient stress on
              CPU/Memory."

ExploratoryCCPDiskFull:
    <<: *P2_STRESS_TAGS
    Testname: ExploratoryCCPDiskFull
    Component: *CCP
    Summary: "Check that CCP is able to realize new desired state on the host
              as expected by MP even when a node has reached the capcacity of
              its secondary storage."

ExploratoryMPDiskFull:
    <<: *P2_STRESS_TAGS
    Testname: ExploratoryMPDiskFull
    Component: *MP
    Summary: "Check that MP is able to work with new desired state when it has
              reached the capcacity of its secondary storage. Or it should
              fail in a graceful manner."
