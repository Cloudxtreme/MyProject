VDNet Python Library Common Modules
------------------------------------


    base_attribute
   ----------------

    base class for all attribute implementations. Attribute objects model all
    attributes contained in schemas.


    base_client
   -------------

    base class for all client classes. Client classes are responsible for
    making method calls to products and product components.


    base_schema
   -------------

    base class for all schema classes. Schema classes encapsulate product and
    product component properties as well as inputs to and outputs from product
    related method calls that are exposed by the clients.


    compute_utilities
   -------------------

    module containing utility methods.


    connection
   ------------

    base class for connection objects. Connection objects are instantiated inside
    client objects. These objects are responsible for the connections to products
    and product components. These objects are specific to execution types like UI,
    CMD and APIs.


    constants
   -----------

     named constants to be used by the rest of the library.


    path
   ------

     base class for path objects. Path objects encapsulate information needed to
     navigate from one product object to another. Each client has an array of
     Path objects that help it navigate to its corresponding product object. Path
     may not be necessary for certain clients and execution types.


    result
   --------

    the result object encapsulates the information coming out from the methods
    exposed by the clients.


    soap_connection
   -----------------

    connection object for soap api execution type.


    ssh_connection
   ----------------

    connection object for ssh cmd execution type.


    status_codes
   --------------

     module that defines a unified set of status codes to be used by the result
     object.
